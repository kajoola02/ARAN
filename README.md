üõ∞Ô∏è ARAN ‚Äì Smart Vehicle Accident Detection & Emergency Alert System

ARAN is an IoT-based safety system designed to detect vehicle accidents in real time and send emergency alerts automatically. Using sensors installed in the vehicle, it identifies sudden impact or vehicle tilt. Once an accident is detected, a 5-minute timer appears in the connected mobile app. If the user does not cancel the alert within 5 minutes, the system automatically sends an emergency message with the vehicle‚Äôs GPS location to the nearest hospital and police station.

The main goal of ARAN is to ensure quick response and immediate medical help during road accidents, potentially saving lives through automation and smart technology.

‚öôÔ∏è Innovation & Impact

ARAN combines IoT and smart automation to bridge the delay between accident occurrence and emergency response. The innovation lies in the self-activating alert mechanism and location-based service integration, reducing the time taken for rescue operations.

This system can significantly reduce road fatalities, enhance public safety, and support emergency services with accurate data and timely notifications.

‚ù§Ô∏è Mission

To create a reliable, AI-assisted, and IoT-enabled smart vehicle safety system that saves lives through faster emergency communication.
